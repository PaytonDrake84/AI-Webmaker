# AI-Webmaker
Description:
Idea for a simple web AI that can create large sections of often repetitive code when given a prompt.
Work and personnal projects may get in the way of continous development, but with
a can do attitude anything is possible!

Planning:
Primary focus would be on creating a database to store potential sections of code that the AI would be
able to call upon. After that a focus on user interface to make it easy and accessible to call the
code. Followed by adding design and flare.
